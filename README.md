# photon_d7ledon_restapi

A cross platform Flutter app (iOS & Android) that blinks a Particle Photon LED over the Internet (using REST API). If you've already tested out the Particle Photon with the Tinker app, then you'll simply need to (a) copy and paste the source code into a new project, (b) update source with your own device id and access token, and (c) compile and load it onto your own device.  Boom! The Photon's D7 LED will turn on.
